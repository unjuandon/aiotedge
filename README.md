Edge AI is an approach to process AI algorithms locally on a hardware device. This has some advantages, such as offline availability, processing latency, limit bandwidth and cellular data usage, security issues, etc. This capability makes it suitable for IoT devices.

A combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) is called Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). AIoT at the edge processes AI algorithms locally on a hardware device instead of the cloud server.

aiotedge.tech is a collection of tutorials and projects that start at the basics and take you through advanced topics. We provide tutorials and projects that covers all of the AIoT technology stack. All in one place from the AI algorithms down to the hardware device, such as ESP32, STM32, Raspberry Pi, etc.
